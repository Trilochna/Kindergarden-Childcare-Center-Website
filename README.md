# Full-Stack Web Application

## Overview
This is a full-stack web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **MySQL**. The application consists of a frontend for user interaction and a backend for data processing and database management.

## Features
- Interactive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Backend server using Node.js with Express for handling API requests.
- MySQL database for data storage and management.
- Deployed for free with services like Netlify/Vercel (Frontend) and Render/Railway (Backend).

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main parts:
- `frontend/`: Contains all the frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- `backend/`: Contains the backend code (Node.js, Express, MySQL).

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Deployment**: Netlify/Vercel (Frontend), Render/Railway (Backend)

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Setup the Backend
- Navigate to the backend directory:
  ```bash
  cd backend/
  ```
- Install the dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Create a `.env` file in the backend directory to store your environment variables:
  ```
  DB_HOST=your-database-host
  DB_USER=your-database-user
  DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
  DB_NAME=your-database-name
  PORT=3000
  ```
- Start the backend server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### 3. Setup the Frontend
- Navigate to the frontend directory:
  ```bash
  cd frontend/
  ```
- Install the frontend dependencies (if using a frontend framework like React):
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Start the frontend development server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### 4. MySQL Setup
Ensure you have MySQL running on your local machine or use a cloud MySQL service like Planetscale, ClearDB, or Railway's MySQL plugin. Create the required database and tables as specified in your backend models.

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment (Netlify/Vercel)
- Push your frontend code to a GitHub repository.
- Connect the repository to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- Deploy the frontend by following the respective platform’s instructions.

### Backend Deployment (Render/Railway)
- Push your backend code to a GitHub repository.
- Connect the repository to [Render](https://render.com/) or [Railway](https://railway.app/).
- Set environment variables for your MySQL database and other settings (e.g., `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, etc.).
- Deploy the backend.

## Usage
- Once deployed, visit the frontend URL, and you will be able to interact with the web application.
- The frontend will make API calls to the backend server to fetch or update data.
- The backend will handle the API requests, process data, and interact with the MySQL database.
